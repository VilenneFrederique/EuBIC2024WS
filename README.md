A short introduction to each separate tool:

## BRAIN
BRAIN, or Baffling Recursive Algorithm for Isotopic distributioN is an algorithm to accurately calculate the aggregated isotope distribution from an elemental composition using a polynomial method.

## Pointless4Peptides
Pointless4Peptides is a novel algorithm to predict the isotope distribution of average peptides based on their monoisotopic mass. Employing penalized spline regression to model the isotope distribution as a function of the monoisotopic mass. The combination of a compositional data representation with penalized spline regression offers a precise and flexible method to model the isotope probabilities. Additionally, acknowledging the importance of Sulphur in the isotope distribution, the model allows for highly accurate detection of Sulphur present in the molecule.

## MIND
MIND or MonoIsotopic liNear preDictor is a framework to accurately predict the monoistopic mass of a precursor peptide, utilizing the most abundant isotope peak.

## QCQuan
QCQuan is an online web application that automatically provides the user with an exploratory and quality control analysis and a differential expression analysis of a quantitative label-based proteomics experiment.

## How to follow the workshop?
In order to run the workshop, you can download the Python Notebook and open it in Google Colab. You have to select an R-kernel to be able to run the code. All other files present in the GitHub repository are loaded into the notebook. The QCQuan related part of the workshop is completely referenced to the specific file.
